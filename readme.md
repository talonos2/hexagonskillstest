What I did:
 - All code you see was written by me.

What I referenced:
 - https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Example-CreatingaBillboardPlane.html because I've never built a mesh from scratch before.
 - https://forum.unity.com/threads/the-current-render-pipeline-is-not-compatible-with-this-master-node.660742/ when Shadergraph failed to work as expected.

What I did not do:
 - I installed the Universal Rendering Pipeline package, built by Unity.
 - I installed the Shadergraph package, built by Unity.
